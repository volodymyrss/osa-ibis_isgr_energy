NAME
    ibis_isgr_energy - Version 9.0
	Performs energy correction for each raw ISGRI event, by using two
	calibration tables (gain/offset then rise-time) and auxiliary files
	(cumulated proton doses, ...).
	The corrected energy is given in keV (with a corrected rise-time).

USAGE

	ibis_isgr_energy
	or any other way permitted by PIL

DESCRIPTION

Due to the charge loss in the CdTe crystal, for a given energy deposit, 
events which have interacted at different depths in the crystal get different
measured amplitudes (PHA). The rise-time of the signal induced by these event
is also different, and a clear quasi-linear correlation between the charge 
loss and the rise-time (RT) variation is observed (a deeper interaction induces
a larger charge loss, at the same time as a larger rise-time). It is then 
possible to correct this charge loss effect, by taking into account the
rise-time information of the signal. It is what is done in this module.
Indeed, the correction is done by rescaling each spectra obtained for a given
rise-time  value, in order to put each corrected event corresponding to a given
energy deposits into the same bin.

In this formula, pha and rt have been made pixel independant with LUT1
(gain/offset for each pixel) and corrected from temperature, cumulated dose of 
protons, rise-time effect. The offset value is a constant.
After correction by LUT1, if the rise-time or the amplitude is out of the LUT2 
table, we take (version 4.1 and after) the last available value of LUT2.

This random generator can have the seed specified in the parameters.
The seed must be an unsigned long strictly below (2^32)-1.
If empty, you will always get the same sequence of random numbers
(since DAL3GEN random function has a default seed).

 With default "eraseALL" input, program deletes all rows in output COR (if any)
and adds rows. With "eraseALL" set to false, keeps existing rows in output COR
and update output columns. In this case, error -122054 is issued if the number
of existing rows do not match data.

 With "useGTI" set to false, the number of GTI is 0 and program treats all
Science Window events even with a PRP structure (for OBT) with no row.
 From version 5.3, with default "useGTI" yes, the event selection is done at
level PRP (instead of RAW) to read OB_TIME limits (correction of SPR 3686).
Beware, with "useGTI" set to false, event selection is still at RAW level
and SPR 3686 cannot be corrected (wrong energy calculation if events do not
fill the whole Science Window).

   The program will exit with the ISDC_OK status on reading errors:
   DAL3IBIS_NO_IBIS_EVENTS or DAL_TABLE_HAS_NO_ROWS. This occurs when input
   group has no ISGRI events from S1 packet.
   Above errors are written into the message log as level 1 Warning.
